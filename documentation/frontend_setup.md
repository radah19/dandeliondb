# Frontend Set up guide
This be easy!
- Open the `.env_template` file, copy & paste into the same directory and then name it to `.env`
- Name the appropriate variables
     - `BACKEND_URL` could be `http://localhost:8080`
     - `FRONTEND_URL` I don't think is used but left there just in case. I left it as `https://dandeliondb.up.railway.app`
     - `PORT` is just 5173 for Vite by default
- On a terminal, run `npm i` in the client directory
- Run `npm run dev` to run locally!
